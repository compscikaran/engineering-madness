This is a rant period. A rant about the cult that has taken over engineering orgs at large enterprises. The cult that demands towing the line, using the magic words, reciting the norms and thinking inside the box. What am I talking about ? Its the culture of conformity. The culture of Software Architects. 

The committee of architects that believe its their god given right to dictate to people how to do their job. The masses must be civilized and educated after all. These software "architects"... A term stolen by the software development community. What a disgrace to an earnest and diligent community of professionals that builds the infrastructure that houses our ignorant colleagues.

The Fake software architects in our industry that make it their life mission to make other people's life harder because its not about solving problems but massaging their egos. The people that talk a big game but cannot build anything of reasonable complexity in the real world. A complete lack of empathy, a complete lack of appreciation for artistry and aesthetics. Robotic. Moronic. A plague.

If not architects then what do we need ? [Staff engineers](https://staffeng.com/). People who operate in the real world. People who still build. People who have asymmetric impact. Its not a title, its a mindset.
